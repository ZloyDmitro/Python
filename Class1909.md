# Data Structure

## Array A collection: 
A collection of elements identify ba index or key. Useful for quickly looking up values based on a shared index or key.

array = ['a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
print (array[0]) Output "a"

## Stack A collection of elements with two main principal operations:
## Queue: Similar to Stack, but follows the FIFO (first in first out) method.

## Tree: A collection of nodes connected in a network struccture. Useful for representing hierarchies and for applications like file systems.
## Graph: A collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them. Useful for representing networks an relationships between objects.

## Hash Table or Hash Map: A data structure this can map keys to values. Useful for quickly looking up values associated with a given key.
    dict= {
        "firstName":"Wissam"
        "lastName": = "Odish"
    }

## Heap: A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Useful for implementing priority queues.

## Set: A collection of distinct entities. Useful vor checking the presence of an element.
